= Description
A library for gathering Azure profile information.

= Prerequisites
* openssl
* json
* nokogiri

= Installation
gem install azure-profile

= Synopsis
require 'azure/profile'

# Assumes ~/.azure/azureProfile.json exists
prof = Azure::Profile.new

# Uses an existing publish settings file
prof = Azure::Profile.new(:settings_file => '/path/to/publishsettingsfile')

p prof.subscriptions
p prof.default_subscription

# Using azure-profile in conjunction with the azure gem
require 'azure'
require 'azure/profile'

prof = Azure::Profile.new
dsub = prof.default.subscription

Azure.configure do |config|
  config.management_certificate = dsub.management_certificate
  config.subscription_id = dsub.subscription_id
  config.management_endpoint = dsub.management_endpoint
end

= Details
The azure-profile gem gathers and wraps your Azure subscription information.
Specifically, it will parse information out of your azureProfile.json file
if present. Alternatively, you can have it use a publishsettings file instead.

With that information you can pass the credentials of the subscription of
your choice to whatever Azure interface you're using, such as the azure gem.

= Getting a publishsettings file
If you want to download a publishsettings file, point your browser at:

https://manage.windowsazure.com/publishsettings/index

Login if you're not already logged in, and it should start a file download.
I recommend putting that file in $HOME/.azure and naming it
"azure.publishsettings" for future convenience.

If you're a powershell user, you can do Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile instead.

A publishsettings file is a simple XML file, so feel free to inspect it
at your convenience.

= Getting an azureProfile.json file
If you've installed and used the cross-platform command line interface, then
you should already have this file. If not, the best way to get one is to install
and login using the command line interface.

= Future Plans
  Allow the option to specify a username and password to automatically
  retrieve a publishsettings file if one isn't found.
